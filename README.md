# wishlist
A repository for students to suggest new services for Chalmers IT-section.

To suggest a new service, create a [new issue](https://github.com/cthit/wishlist/issues).

## How to suggest a new service

All serious suggestions are welcome, big and small, easy and hard. But to increase the chances of your idea becoming reality, it's good to include the following headers:

* A catchy name
* A description of the idea
* A reason: "This service would be great because ..."
* Features: any fun extra features you can think of.

There is an [example issue](https://github.com/cthit/wishlist/issues/1) that you can look at for inspiration on how to structure your suggestion.
